## The Problem
Teachers lack a proper teacher-to-teacher network that enables collaboration between those in different fields, schools, and teaching experience. Hawaii’s education system has yet to attain an inclusive, high-quality education for all students. With the rapidly-changing workforce ahead of new generations, teachers must provide their students with the knowledge they need to thrive and build a sustainable future for Hawai’i. Powerful teacher-to-teacher networks enable teachers in Hawaii to develop and utilize lesson plans that promote learner-oriented lifelong learning.

## The Solution
Edulime is a collaborative network hub for educators that promotes transformational learning, as well as a collection of the best tools to support them. The platform allows teachers from any school to connect with other teachers to share, find, and annotate educational resources. Edulime makes it easy for teachers to create engaging and effective lessons that foster equitable access to education and provide teachers with useful and practical tools to revolutionize the way they teach.

## The Features
### The Innovation Board
The core of this platform is built around the idea of ideation and innovation through collaboration. The Innovation Board is a digital version of a creative space that allows effective, real-time collaboration with other teachers. The Innovation Board is an instantaneous markup and annotation tool that works across the Internet with multiple users. It takes the hassle out of file sharing and platform mismatches. It remains professional and respects the privacy of teachers while conducive to higher productivity. The ingenuity behind the Innovation Board comes from the interconnected system between the various tools of the platform. Any file in the Resource Library can be edited collaboratively with other teachers in the Innovation Board, sparking new ideas and connections.

### The Resource Library
The Resource Library is a powerful tool that allows teachers to upload and browse a multitude of lesson plans, worksheets, assignments, and other educational resources. Most notably, teachers can open a resource in the Innovation Board, allowing them to annotate and collaborate in real-time with other teachers.

### Creative Spaces
The Creative Spaces tool is a growing directory of physical places such as coffee shops, libraries, and coworking spaces where educators can work together. They can also meet with other educators at these locations to collaborate, discuss, and co-create lesson plans. Direct face-to-face communication fosters stronger networks between various teachers from different schools, departments, and subjects.

### Teacher Match
The Teacher Match tool allows teachers to find and connect with other teachers. Profiles of similar teachers are shown by category. The ability to filter by department, subject, and/or school allows teachers to specify what type of teachers they are looking to network with.
